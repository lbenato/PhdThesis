\section{Data and simulations comparison}
\label{sec:datamc_comp}

In this section, a comparison between data and simulation is reported for various kinematic observables. It can be seen that the dominant background contribution comes from the \Z + jets and \W + jets production, while sub-leading contributions from top (\ttbar and single-top) production and dibosons can be minor yet non-negligible.

\noindent In the following plots (fig.~\ref{fig:plot_uno}-\ref{fig:plot_last}), the comparison is performed in three different regions. On top of the selections defined above, additional criteria are defined:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Inclusive}: no selection is performed on top of the selections, except for a veto on the jet mass $65 < m_V < 135\GeV$ to avoid potential signal contamination from \VZ signals;
  \item \textit{Sidebands (SB)}: only events in the sidebands, defined the interval between $30 < m_V < 65$ \GeV and $m_V > 135$ \GeV are considered. This region can be considered as signal-depleted. The main difference with the previous regions is that the bulk of the jet mass distribution, peaking at $m_V \sim 20\GeV$, is not included. The region selected is thus much closer kinematically to the signal region.
  \item \textit{Signal region (SR)}: it represents the phase space where is signal is expected. %The signal region is considered {\bf blind}, so data are not shown in these plots.
\end{itemize}

\noindent A summary of the number of expected events from Monte Carlo simulations, per each sample, along with the number of events observed in data in each category is reported in tab.~\ref{tab:event_number_MC}. No significant excess is observed in data distributions with regards to simulation predictions in signal region.
