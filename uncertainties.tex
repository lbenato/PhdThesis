\section{Systematic uncertainties}

\color{red}
\noindent The \V-tagging scale factors are measured in \ttbar samples, hence at \pt values generally not larger than 200--300 \GeV. An uncertainty due to the \V-tagging extrapolation at higher momenta is considered by using an alternative showering scheme (HERWIG~\cite{bib:HERWIG}). It is parametrized as a function of the jet \pt: $X \times \log(\pt/200 \GeV)$, where $X=0.085$ for the high-purity category and $X=0.039$ for low-purity category. It amounts to 9-20\%, depending on the mass of the signal sample considered, to 2-3\% for VV and Top backgrounds in high-low purity category. While combining the categories, \V-tagging extrapolation uncertainties are considered as correlated.
