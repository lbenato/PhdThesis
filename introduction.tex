This analysis searches for signal of heavy resonances decaying into a pair of heavy vector bosons. 
One Z boson is identified through its invisible decay ($\nu \nu$), while the other is required to decay hadronically into a pair of quarks.
The final states probed by this analysis therefore consists in two quarks and two neutrinos, reconstructed as missing transverse energy (met).
The hadronically decaying boson (Z, W) is reconstructed as a fat jet, whose mass is used to define the signal region.
Two purity categories are exploited, based on the n-subjettines of the fat jet.

The search is performed by examining the distribution of the diboson reconstructed transverse mass of the resonance VZ (mtVZ) for a localized excess. 
The shape and normalization of the main background of the analysis (V+jets) are estimated with an hybrid approach using the distribution of data in the sidebands, corrected for a function accounting for potential differences between the signal region and the sidebands, while the minor background sources are taken from simulations.

%The discovery of the Higgs Boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the CERN LHC~\cite{bib:Aad20121, bib:Chatrchyan201230, Chatrchyan:2013lba} marks the completion of the standard model (SM) of particle physics.
%However, the relatively light value of the h boson mass $m_h \approx 125$~GeV\cite{Khachatryan:2014jba,Aad:2014aba,Aad:2013xqa,Aad:2015zhl} leaves the hierarchy problem between the electroweak (EW) and the Planck energy scales unsolved, pointing to phenomena beyond the SM (BSM).

%There are several theory models that motivate the existence of heavy particles that decay to pairs of vector bosons. Bounds from previous searches~\cite{Khachatryan:2015lba, Khachatryan:2015bma, Khachatryan:2015ywa, Khachatryan:2016yji, CMS:2015nmz, CMS:2016dzw} have pushed the mass of these resonances above the $1 \TeV$ energy scale. These models usually aim to explain open questions of the SM such as the breaking of the EW, or the integration of gravity into the SM using extra dimensions. Among the models under scrutiny in this analysis are the Warped Extra Dimension (WED) models~\cite{Randall:1999ee,Randall:1999vf}, which predict the existence of a spin-2 massive Graviton.
%In the original Randall-Sundrum WED model (RS) only gravity is allowed to propagate in the extra dimensional bulk space; alternatively, in the bulk WED model (bulk)~\cite{Agashe:2007zd,Fitzpatrick:2007qr,Antipin:2007pi} both gravity and SM particles are allowed to propagate along the extra dimension. Two parameters are used to describe the model: the mass of the foreseen spin-2 graviton and $\tilde{k}=k/\overline{M}_{Planck}$ (assumed equal to 0.1 in this document), where $k$ is the curvature factor and $\overline{M}_{Planck}=M_{Planck}/\sqrt{8 \pi}$.
%Alternatively, heavy spin-1 resonances decaying to pair of bosons are also predicted by weakly coupled spin-1 $\Z'$~\cite{Barger:1980ix,Salvioni:2009mt} and $W'$ models~\cite{Grojean:2011vu} or strongly coupled Composite Higgs~\cite{Contino2011,Marzocca2012,Bellazzini:2014yua}, Little Higgs models~\cite{Han:2003wu,Schmaltz,Perelstein2007247}. These theories are generalized in the Heavy Vector Triplet (HVT) framework~\cite{Pappadopulo2014}, that introduces additional terms in the SM lagrangian, multiplied by three parameters describing the strength of the interaction ($g_V$) and the couplings of the spin-1 heavy resonances to SM fermions ($c_F$) and bosons ($c_H$).
