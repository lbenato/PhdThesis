\section{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:uncertainties}

The background and signal predictions are affected by systematic uncertainties that have to be estimated and taken into account in the signal extraction procedure. This section includes a list of the relevant systematic uncertainties for this analysis and how they are estimated.% Most of the systematic uncertainties are dedicated to samples that are not normalized on data or the shape is taken from simulation.


\subsection{Uncertainties affecting the data-driven main background estimation}

\subsubsection{Normalization}

The main background, \V + jets, takes both the normalization and the shape from data. The normalization is extracted from fits to the jet mass sidebands with arbitrary functions tested on simulation. The contribution of the sub-dominant backgrounds is also taken into account, for both the normalization and the shape, and propagated to the main background prediction.

\noindent The uncertainties on the sub-dominant backgrounds normalization, namely the uncertainties on the parameters describing the jet mass spectra obtained with the fits performed on simulations, are propagated to the main background yield prediction. An additional uncertainty on the main background comparison comes from the fit with the alternative function. In this case, the difference in the predicted number of events between the two function choices is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The limited number of events in data in the sidebands is treated separately as a source of statistical uncertainty. Numerical values are reported channel by channel in tab.~\ref{tab:BkgNorm}.

%\noindent The top and diboson normalization uncertainties depends on the knowledge of the cross-sections of these processes in the considered phase-space, and it is estimated to be $10\%$ and $15\%$, respectively (sec.~\ref{ssec:backgrounds}).

\subsubsection{Shape}

The shape uncertainties on main background are determined with the $\alpha$-method, explained in sec.~\ref{ssec:alphaShape}. The uncertainties on the parameters of the main background prediction in the signal regions are affected by the parameter error of the fit to \mtVZ in data in the jet mass sidebands, and from the $\alpha$-function itself, which depends on the \mtVZ fits to the simulated \V + jets distributions in SR and SB. These uncertainties are propagated to the shape of the main background in the signal region. Before being provided to the likelihood fit, these parameters are decorrelated through a linear transformation.

\subsection{Uncertainties affecting the signal and the sub-dominant backgrounds}

\subsubsection{Trigger uncertainty}

Trigger uncertainty is evaluated shifting by one standard deviation (\text{i.e.} 1\%) the \MET trigger efficiency calculated on data, that is applied as per-event weight to MC samples. The impact has been studied in signal and secondary background samples: it ampunts to 0.7-0.5\% for signal samples, depending on the mass hypotesis, whilst it affects by 1\% the top and diboson normalization. No effect can be appreciated in signal and background shapes.

\subsubsection{Jet momentum uncertainties}

Jet uncertainties are evaluated in the signal regions by moving up and down by one standard deviation the source of the uncertainty. The two sources are the uncertainty on the jet energy correction, also identified as jet energy scale (JES)~\cite{bib:1748-0221-6-11-P11002},~\cite{CMS-DP-2016-020}, and the uncertainty due to the different jet momentum resolution (JER)~\cite{CMS-DP-2016-020}.

\noindent For the jet energy scale, the \pt of the jets are shifted by the error value of the jet energy corrections. The difference in the normalization of the jet energy correction is propagated to the signal region, taking into account the effect on the \MET as well, in a correlated fashion.

\noindent The JER effect is evaluated (together with its impact on \MET) by smearing the jet \pt by the $\eta$-dependent coefficients listed in tab.~\ref{tab:smear}, up and down by one standard deviation, using the hybrid-method (sec.~\ref{ssec:jets}).% The relative difference in normalization amounts to $2--3\%$ in signal samples.

\noindent The impact of JEC uncertainties is evaluated also on the signal and background shapes.

\noindent The resulting normalization and shape uncertainties are reported in sec.~\ref{metuncsec}.%The uncertainty is found to be stable with the resonance mass between channels and categories, and is found to be $---\%$ for the mean, and $---\%$ for the width.

\subsubsection{Jet mass uncertainties}

The soft drop PUPPI corrected jet mass is affected by two different uncertainties sources.

\noindent Soft drop jet mass calibration is varied within $\pm \sqrt{ \left( \text{JES}_\text{unc.}^2 + \text{JMS}_\text{unc.}^2 \right) }$, where $\text{JES}_\text{unc.}$ is the uncertainty of the JES, and $\text{JMS}_\text{unc.}=0.0094$ is a constant coefficent (~\ref{ssec:jetmass},\cite{bib:1748-0221-6-11-P11002},~\cite{CMS-DP-2016-020}). The impact is calculated on signal and secondary backgrounds, both in normalization and shape.

\noindent As regarding the smearing, the soft drop Puppi corrected jet mass of the signal samples and sub-dominant backgrounds has been smeared up or down by a smearing coefficient (described in sec.~\ref{ssec:jetmass}), that is $ \text{JMR} = 1.00 \pm 0.20$.

\noindent Results are presented in detail in tab.~\ref{tab:jet_mass_energy_corr}-\ref{tab:jet_mass_res_corr}, for JMS and JMR uncertainties. Shape uncertainties on signal are evaluated as the variation in the mean and RMS of the transverse mass distribution. Shape uncertainties on top and diboson backgrounds are quoted as the relative variation in the slope of the exponential falling distribution of \mtVZ, and their effects are shown in fig. \ref{fig:sysJMS}-\ref{fig:sysJMR}.

\subsubsection{\V-tagging uncertainties}
\label{sec:wtagunc}

Data-Monte Carlo \V-tagging scale factors are applied to the signal and secondary background yields (sec.~\ref{ssec:jetsub_corr}), and their uncertainty is taken as systematic. The contribution of the uncertainty is 11\% for the high-purity and 23\% for low-purity category, applied on signal and secondary backgrounds. While combining the categories, \V-tagging uncertainties are considered as anti-correlated.

\noindent The \V-tagging scale factors are measured in \ttbar samples, hence at \pt values generally not larger than 200--300 \GeV. An uncertainty due to the \V-tagging extrapolation at higher momenta is considered by using an alternative showering scheme (HERWIG~\cite{bib:HERWIG}). It is parametrized as a function of the jet \pt: $X \times \log(\pt/200 \GeV)$, where $X=0.085$ for the high-purity category and $X=0.039$ for low-purity category. It amounts to 9-20\%, depending on the mass of the signal sample considered, to 2-3\% for \VV and Top backgrounds in high-low purity category. While combining the categories, \V-tagging extrapolation uncertainties are considered as correlated.


\subsubsection{b-tagging uncertainties}
\label{sec:btagunc}
The assigned b-tagging uncertainty, related to the b-tag veto applied to AK4 jets that lay outside the \V jet cone, with the aim of suppressing the top quark induced background, is the relative difference in shape and normalization, calculated in signal and secondary background events, obtained shifting up or down the event weight through the envelope of the data-MC b-tagging scale factors uncertainties~\cite{bib:btagsf}.

\noindent The impact of this systematic uncertainty on signal normalization ranges from 0.7\% at 1 \TeV, up to 1.0\% at 4 \TeV. The impact on \VV background normalization is 0.3\%, whilst on Top it is 2.2\%. Effects on signal and background shapes are negligible.

\subsubsection{Missing Energy uncertainties}
\label{metuncsec}
As described in sec.~\ref{ssec:met_description}, the \MET evaluation depends on all the reconstructed particles in the event, and on their uncertainties. Missing energy uncertainties are calculated by factorizing \met in components: electrons, photons, muons, taus, jets and unclustered energy. Dedicated uncertainties are derived by propagating the original object scales and resolutions to the \MET itself.

\noindent In this analysis, a leptonic veto is applied, hence the \MET uncertainties are due to jets and unclustered energy. The effect of JES is evaluated on \MET in a correlated way with the jet, by scaling up or down the central value of JES by one sigma, both on \MET and on jet \pt. The result is a neglibile uncertainty on signal normalization, 0.2\% and less than 0.1\% uncertainty on top and diboson normalization, negligible uncertainty on signal, top and diboson shapes.

\noindent The same procedure applies for the uncertainties related to jet JER, that are varied up and down by one sigma in both jet and \met at the same time. The result is a negligible uncertainty on signal and diboson normalization, 0.3\% uncertainty on top normalization, and negligible effects on signal and background shapes.

\noindent The last contribution in \met uncertainty is related to unclustered energy, whose impact is evaluated scaling up or down the central value by its own resolution, depending on the particle type. The uncertainty is evaluated to be negligible on signal and background normalization and shape.

\subsubsection{Pile-up uncertainty}
An additional source of systematic error is the limited knowledge of the total inelastic cross-section at $13 \TeV$, used to get the expected primary vertices distribution for the pile-up reweighting procedure. A $4.6\%$ uncertainty is assumed for the default value of $69\,200$ mb, and the expected primary vertices distributions are varied accordingly (fig.~\ref{fig:PU_updown}). Changing the pile-up weight varies also the MC normalization in the signal regions, and the relative difference is estimated to be 0.2\% for the diboson background, 0.3\% for top samples, and 0.4-0.7\% for signal samples. PU impact on signal shapes is negligible, and it impacts by 0.8\% and 0.4\% the diboson and top shapes (fig.~\ref{fig:syspileup}). %No shape uncertainties are considered for PU. %$3\%$ for the diboson and top samples, and a flat $0.5\%$ for signal samples. No shape uncertainties are considered for PU.

 \end{figure}


\subsubsection{QCD renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties}

Divergencies appearing in perturbative QCD calculation, used to predict the cross-section and spectra of the observables in Monte Carlo simulations, are absorbed by the renormalization and factorization scales. Per-event weights are calculated for a variation of these scales by a factor 2. The two scales can be varied separately and independently, or together assuming 100\% correlation; the first approach is adopted. The weight is propagated up to the final distributions, accounting for normalization and shape uncertainties.

\noindent The QCD variations have negligible effect on signal acceptance and on the mean and sigma of the Gaussian core of the Crystal Balls. The QCD factorization has an impact on top background shape (1.1\%) and normalization (3.1\%), and on diboson normalization (0.9\%). The QCD renormalization affects the top normalization (7.3\%) and diboson normalization (1.3\%).

 \end{figure}


\subsubsection{PDF}

Systematic uncertainties coming from PDF uncertainties are estimated according to the PDF4LHC prescriptions~\cite{Butterworth:2015oua}, and using the NNPDF3.1~\cite{Ball:2017nwa} set. Each parameter describing the PDF is varied within its uncertainty. The 100 different weights have been considered together, by calculating the effect of their envelope around the central value of the expected event yield and of the \mtVZ distributions, and propagated as a shape uncertainty. The effect of the PDF uncertainty on the signal acceptance is found to be negligible, and it amounts to 10.3\% for top background and 2.1\% for diboson background. It affects top shape by 1.2\%.

\subsection{Summary}

A summary of all systematics is listed in tab.~\ref{tab:Sys}. In addition to those described in the previous sections, $10\%$ uncertainty on normalization is assumed on the cross-section value of top background from CMS measurements (see sec.~\ref{ssec:backgrounds}), $15\%$ of uncertainty is assigned to the cross-section value of diboson background, $3\%$ to cover the uncertainty related to the tau veto, and a $2.5\%$ uncertainty for luminosity~\cite{CMS:2017sdi}.
